Symmetric difference (commonly denoted by Δ) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both.

For example, sym([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4]) should yield [3, 4, 5].

Following above definition, symmetric difference of three sets A, B, and C can be expressed as (A &Delta; B) &Delta; C.
